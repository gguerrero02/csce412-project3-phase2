                My name is Garrett Guerrero. I am a computer science major at Texas A&M University.
                I consider myself a very well-rounded individual, so I bring a wide range of skills
                to the table and am always open to mastering new ones. First and foremost, I have a 
                deep love and appreciation for the STEM field - I find the endless stream of problems
                being solved every day with new ideas and technological advances absolutely inspiring. 
                However, STEM isn’t my only passion. The arts play a huge role in my daily life. Music, 
                art, and design act as a driving force for me to not only deliver functional solutions to 
                problems, but beautiful and expressive solutions as well. Expression is such an important 
                part of who we are as humans, so why should we limit ourselves to bare-bones solutions? 
                As I have made my way through college and participated in group labs, projects, and 
                presentations, I have fostered my love of people. I believe in the power of building 
                up those around you, that making strong interpersonal connections can lead to more 
                innovation, creativity, and expression. I have also had the opportunity to act as an 
                assistant director for a sustainability-based social organization on campus called 
                SPIES (Sophomores Progressing in Excellence and Sustainability). I am currently helping 
                lead the public relations committee, so not only do I get to nurture my creative side 
                by designing merchandise and infographics, but I get to witness those that I lead grow 
                closer together as friends. I hope whatever teams I lead in the future will grow 
                together in the same way. Through my fascination with STEM, love of art, and desire 
                to become the best leader and team-member that I can be. I believe my wide skill set 
                also allows me to approach ideas with unique perspectives, so I think I make a great 
                candidate for any team-based work environment!
