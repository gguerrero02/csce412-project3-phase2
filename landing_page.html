        <p><strong>Howdy, My name is Garrett Guerrero!</strong></p>
        <p>
            My name is Garrett Guerrero. I am a computer science 
            major at Texas A&M University. I like to consider myself 
            a pretty well-rounded individual. While I have a deep 
            love and appreciation for the STEM field, I often find 
            myself lost in the arts. Music, art, and design are all a 
            huge part of who I am and act as a driving force for me
            to not only deliver a functional product, but an enticing
            one as well. As I have participated in group labs in my 
            classes and have acted as an assitant director for a 
            sustainability-based social organization on campus, 
            I have also fostered my love of people and making strong 
            interpersonal connections so that I can be a better leader
            as I enter my career. So, click around and find out a little
            more about me. I hope you like what you see!
        </p>
